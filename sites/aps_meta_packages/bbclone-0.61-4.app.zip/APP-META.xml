  <summary>Feature rich counter</summary>
  <description>  BBclone is a web counter written in PHP. It looks similar to Big Brother Webstats.
  But it is not *just* a counter : BBClone gives a detailed view of the visitors of your web site.
  It does it by displaying the n-th last users (and the data they provided, like their IP, browser and so on) that went
  of the web site, not just showing a number of visitors. This is very handy
  for slow to medium traffic web site webmasters that want to see who visit
  their sites, what browser people use, where do they come from etc. Please
  note that it's very design, BBclone is not useful for high traffic websites
  where you only need agregated data.
