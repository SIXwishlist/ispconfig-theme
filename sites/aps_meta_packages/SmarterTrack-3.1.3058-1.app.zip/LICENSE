<p>
Subject to the terms and conditions of this EULA, SmarterTools hereby grants You a revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the Software ("License") in accordance with the terms and conditions of this EULA. This License shall commence on the effective date of this EULA and shall remain in effect until terminated in accordance with the terms of this EULA or superseded by another end user license agreement pursuant to installation of an Update or changes in Features Selection. SmarterTools, together with any third party content providers whose software code is incorporated in the Software or distributed with it, retains all right, title, and interest to the Software, including, but not limited to, copyrights, trademarks, proprietary methods, and trade secrets incorporated into the Software.</p>
<p>
This License is subject to any restrictions SmarterTools, in its sole discretion, may impose in this EULA or imposed as a condition of purchase, including but not limited to the particular Features Selection You chose at the time of purchase. Updates and Features Selection are subject to the terms and conditions of this EULA, or any other end user license agreement provided with such Update or Features Selection at the time of receipt or purchase, which shall supersede this EULA.</p>

This License to use the Software is conditioned upon You paying all related charges and fees imposed by SmarterTools for purchase or monthly-license of the Software. SmarterTools may, in its sole discretion, terminate this License if You fail to pay such charges or fees within the time allowed by SmarterTools.</p>

<p>
You shall use the Software for Your own personal or internal business purposes. Personal or internal business purposes shall include the installation of the Software and activation of only one License key on a single personal computer or server, one instance of a Virtual Private Server, or as one instance within Your portion of a Shared Hosting environment, for Your own use or use by Your Customer(s) pursuant to the terms of section 1.C. below.</p>

You may install and maintain the Software on behalf of a third party; however, all SmarterTools Licenses in such circumstances must be purchased by the third party directly through SmarterTools or through a SmarterTools Authorized Reseller and the Software must be activated under the name of the related third party; thereby, the related third party assumes full ownership of the License subject to the terms and conditions of this EULA.</p>
<p>

<p>
7. Jurisdiction.</p>
<p>
This Agreement shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the United States and the State of Arizona, except for conflict of laws provisions.

Any deviation from these limitations must be approved in writing by SmarterTools in advance of implementation and may result in additional license fees, if applicable.</p>
<p>

You hereby expressly consent to such communications. If you do not wish to receive further notices, you may notify SmarterTools of your preferences.</p>
